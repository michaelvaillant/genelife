**Game of Life with Integrated Genome and Graphics**

*Description*

This project is an advanced implementation of Conway's "Game of Life," enhanced with a genome system that adds evolutionary dynamics and movement to cells. It includes an interactive visualization using HTML5 Canvas and offers a simulation system with multiple user controls.

*Features*
-	Game of Life Simulation: Based on Conway's classic rules with evolutionary elements.
-	Integrated Genome: Each cell can have genetic characteristics defining its survival, reproduction, and movement.
-	Interactive Visualization: Uses multiple canvases to display the simulation grid and statistical graphs.
-	Customization: Allows modifying the grid size, simulation speed, and using a random seed.
-	Obstacle Management and Presets: Adds cross-shaped obstacles and predefined worlds.
-	Dynamic Graphs: Displays population and energy evolution over time.
-	User Controls: Manage the simulation via buttons and interactive selectors.

*Installation*
No installation requiredâ€”simply open the index.html file in a JavaScript-compatible browser.

*Usage*

1.	Start the simulation: It runs automatically with default settings.
2.	Change grid size: Select a size in the "Board" dropdown menu.
3.	Modify speed: Adjust the value in "Wait" to speed up or slow down the simulation.
4.	Change seed: Enter a value in "Seed" to generate different configurations.
5.	Reset the simulation: Click "Reset" to choose a new seed or a predefined world.
6.	Observe cells: Click on a cell to display its genetic characteristics and state.
7.	Select an area: Drag the mouse to analyze a specific region.

*Technologies Used*

-	HTML5 / CSS3: Structure and styling.
-	JavaScript (ES6): Manages the simulation and user interactions.
-	Canvas API: Enables interactive graphical rendering.
-	Seedrandom.js: Handles random seed generation.

*Future Improvements*
-	Adding a multiplayer mode.
-	Introducing new genes for complex behaviors.
-	Performance optimization for larger grids.
